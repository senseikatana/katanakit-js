# Reactive

`reactive.service.ts` is a **function module**: standalone `use*` helpers with no
instance to create and no runtime to bootstrap. A signal is a plain callable
getter (`count()`) paired with a setter (`setCount(1)`); effects and memos
subscribe to signals by passing their getters in an explicit dependency array.
Dependency tracking is **push-based**: every signal owns a listener set and
notifies it when the value changes. There is no proxy magic, no component tree
and no scheduler — the primitives work in any JavaScript runtime that supports
ES2015+.

Use it when you need reactivity **without a framework**:

- vanilla TypeScript widgets and progressive-enhancement scripts;
- [Astro islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) client scripts
  that should not pull a React/Vue/Solid runtime into the bundle;
- shared modules consumed by several frameworks at once;
- small state graphs where a full state library would be overkill.

For server data, caching and retries reach for
[Query Client](/guides/query-client) instead; for DOM observation use
[Watch](/guides/watch).

## SSR behavior

Signals, effects, memos and toggles are pure JavaScript: they import safely on
the server and never touch `window` or `document`. Three server-side caveats
apply:

- **Module scope is process scope.** On the server, a signal created at module
  level lives for the life of the process and is shared by every request.
  Create signals inside the request handler when the value is request-bound.
- **Storage degrades safely.** `useCreateStorageSignal()` relies on the
  [Storage](/guides/services/storage) service, which returns `null` outside the
  browser (falling back to an ephemeral in-memory store). The signal starts from
  its fallback value. Wrap a request handler in `useRunStorageScope()` when
  server-side calls must share state within one request only.
- **Effects run once at creation.** Because `useCreateEffect()` executes its
  callback immediately, an SSR pass runs effects once with the initial values.
  Keep server effects free of browser APIs, or use
  [`useIsBrowser()`](/guides/services/dom#useisbrowser) as a guard.

## Cleanup and disposal

Nothing is torn down implicitly — every primitive that can keep a subscription
or a timer alive exposes an explicit handle:

| Primitive                | Teardown handle                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useCreateEffect()`      | `dispose()` returned by the helper, runs the final cleanup      |
| `useCreateSignal()`      | `getter.useSubscribe()` returns an unsubscribe function         |
| `useCreateDebouncedSignal()` | `setter.useCancel()` aborts the pending write              |
| `useCreateMemo()`        | none — it is a read-only value driven by its dependencies       |
| `useCreateBatch()`       | none — flushing is synchronous                                  |

In a component framework, call these from the matching lifecycle hook
(`onUnmounted`, `useEffect` cleanup, `onDestroy`); in a plain script, call them
when the widget is removed.

## Quick example

```ts
import {
  useCreateSignal, useCreateEffect, useCreateMemo,
  useCreateToggle, useCreateStorageSignal, useCreateDebouncedSignal,
} from "katanakit-js";

// Basic signal: callable getter + value-or-updater setter
const [count, setCount] = useCreateSignal(0);
console.log(count()); // 0
setCount(5);
console.log(count()); // 5

// Effect — re-runs when a subscribed signal changes (deps are explicit)
const disposeEffect = useCreateEffect(() => {
  console.log("Count changed:", count());
}, [count]);

// Memo — derived value, recomputed when count changes
const doubled = useCreateMemo(() => count() * 2, [count]);

// Toggle — boolean signal with useSet/useToggle helpers
const [isOpen, { useToggle }] = useCreateToggle(false);
useToggle(); // isOpen() === true

// Storage-persisted signal — reads at creation, writes through on set
const [theme, setTheme] = useCreateStorageSignal("theme", "light");

// Debounced signal — setter commits after 300 ms of quiet
const [search, setSearch] = useCreateDebouncedSignal("", 300);

// Later, during teardown
disposeEffect();
```

## Signals

### useCreateSignal(initialValue)

Creates the source primitive every other helper builds on.

**Parameters**

| Name           | Type | Description                |
| -------------- | ---- | -------------------------- |
| `initialValue` | `T`  | Initial value of the signal |

**Returns** `[SignalGetter<T>, SignalSetter<T>]`:

- the **getter** is callable (`count()`) and exposes
  `useSubscribe(listener)` — the listener receives `(newValue, oldValue)` and
  the call returns an unsubscribe function;
- the **setter** accepts either a value or an updater
  `(prev: T) => T`, so increments do not need a read-then-write sequence.

```ts
import { useCreateSignal } from "katanakit-js";

const [count, setCount] = useCreateSignal(0);

count();                       // 0
setCount(1);                   // direct value
setCount((prev) => prev + 1);  // updater — prev is the current value
count();                       // 2

const unsubscribe = count.useSubscribe((newValue, oldValue) => {
  console.log(`${oldValue} -> ${newValue}`);
});

setCount(10); // logs "2 -> 10"
unsubscribe(); // stop listening
```

**Cleanup rules and edge cases**

- **Equality gate.** Notifications fire only when `newValue !== oldValue`.
  Setting the same primitive value (or the same object reference) is silent.
  For objects and arrays, always pass a new reference
  (`setUser({ ...user, name: "Ada" })`); in-place mutation followed by
  `setUser(user)` will **not** notify.
- **Listener isolation.** A throwing listener is caught and logged through
  [`useLogger()`](/guides/services/logger) (`[createSignal] Listener error:`);
  it never breaks the setter or the other listeners.
- **Unsubscribe is not automatic.** Every `useSubscribe()` call owns its own
  removal function; clearing a component without calling it leaks the listener.
- **Batch-aware.** Inside a `batch()` block, notifications are deferred until
  the outermost batch completes (see
  [`useCreateBatch()`](#usecreatebatch)).

**Real use case** — an Astro island filter bar: hold the query and the selected
tag in signals, keep them in the client script only, and let the browser bundle
stay free of any UI framework.

```ts
const [query, setQuery] = useCreateSignal("");
const [tag, setTag] = useCreateSignal<string | null>(null);

document.querySelector("input")?.addEventListener("input", (event) => {
  setQuery((event.target as HTMLInputElement).value);
});
```

### useCreateToggle(initialValue = false)

A thin boolean specialization of `useCreateSignal()` with ergonomic setters.

**Parameters**

| Name           | Type      | Default | Description        |
| -------------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| `initialValue` | `boolean` | `false` | Starting state     |

**Returns** `[SignalGetter<boolean>, ToggleSignalSetter]` where the second item
exposes:

- `useSet(value: boolean)` — same semantics as the signal setter;
- `useToggle()` — flips the current value using an updater, so it is safe to
  call at any time, including inside `batch()`.

```ts
import { useCreateToggle } from "katanakit-js";

const [isOpen, { useSet, useToggle }] = useCreateToggle();
isOpen();    // false
useToggle();
isOpen();    // true
useSet(false);
isOpen();    // false
```

**Real use case** — a disclosure widget: the toggle drives an
`aria-expanded` attribute without duplicating boolean state in a data
attribute.

```ts
const [expanded, { useToggle }] = useCreateToggle(false);

useCreateEffect(() => {
  useSetAttribute("#faq-trigger", "aria-expanded", String(expanded()));
}, [expanded]);
```

### useCreateDebouncedSignal(initialValue, delayMs = 300)

Wraps a signal with a trailing debounce on **writes**. The getter continues to
return the last committed value; callers of the setter keep scheduling new
writes until the input goes quiet.

**Parameters**

| Name           | Type     | Default | Description                          |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `initialValue` | `T`      | —       | Initial value                        |
| `delayMs`      | `number` | `300`   | Quiet period before the write commits |

**Returns** `[SignalGetter<T>, SignalSetter<T> & { useCancel: () => void }]`.
The setter behaves like a regular signal setter, but each call clears the
previous pending timer. `useCancel()` aborts the pending write.

```ts
import { useCreateDebouncedSignal, useCreateEffect } from "katanakit-js";

const [query, setQuery] = useCreateDebouncedSignal("", 300);

input.addEventListener("input", (event) => {
  setQuery((event.target as HTMLInputElement).value); // reschedules on each keystroke
});

// Runs only after 300 ms without typing
useCreateEffect(() => {
  const value = query().trim();
  if (value) void search(value);
}, [query]);

setQuery.useCancel(); // e.g. on widget teardown — drop any pending write
```

**Cleanup rules and edge cases**

- **Trailing only.** The first keystroke does not update the signal; only the
  last one in a burst does, `delayMs` after the burst ends.
- **Updater functions run at flush time.** Because the debounced setter
  forwards the argument to the underlying signal when the timer fires,
  `setQuery((prev) => prev + "!")` is computed against the value at flush time,
  not at call time.
- **Always cancel on teardown.** A pending `setTimeout` keeps the callback
  reachable; on the server it can also delay process shutdown. Call
  `setQuery.useCancel()` when the owning widget is removed.
- **Not a replacement for a raw signal.** Only committed values reach
  subscribers. If another part of the UI must reflect every keystroke
  immediately, keep a plain signal for the raw input and debounce the value you
  feed to expensive consumers.

**Real use case** — search-as-you-type in a vanilla widget: debounce the input
signal, then drive a fetch from an effect so the network sees one request per
pause instead of one per keystroke.

## Derived state

### useCreateMemo(computation, signals)

Creates a **read-only derived signal**. The computation runs once at creation
and again whenever any dependency notifies; the result is stored in an internal
signal and exposed as a `SignalGetter<T>`.

**Parameters**

| Name          | Type                        | Description                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `computation` | `() => T`                   | Pure function deriving the value             |
| `signals`     | `Subscribable<unknown>[]`   | Signals the computation depends on           |

**Returns** `SignalGetter<T>` — callable, and subscribable through
`useSubscribe`, which means a memo can be used as a dependency of effects and
other memos.

```ts
import { useCreateSignal, useCreateMemo, useCreateEffect } from "katanakit-js";

const [a, setA] = useCreateSignal(2);
const [b, setB] = useCreateSignal(3);

const sum = useCreateMemo(() => a() + b(), [a, b]);
sum(); // 5

setA(10);
sum(); // 13

// Memos are valid dependencies for effects too
useCreateEffect(() => {
  console.log("sum is", sum());
}, [sum]);
```

**Cleanup rules and edge cases**

- **Eager, not lazy.** `computation()` runs at creation even if nobody reads
  the memo, and again on every dependency change. Keep it cheap, or drive
  expensive work from an effect with your own caching.
- **Equality gate on the result.** The internal signal only notifies when the
  computed value changes (`!==`). `useCreateMemo(() => x() % 2, [x])` does not
  notify when `x` moves from `1` to `3`.
- **No dispose function.** The internal effect subscribes to the dependency
  signals for the life of the graph. Create short-lived memos only when their
  dependencies are also short-lived, or rebuild the graph per request/widget.
- **Empty dependency array.** `useCreateMemo(() => expensive(), [])` computes
  exactly once and never recomputes — useful for constants, but a silent
  bug when you forget a dependency.
- **Composition.** Pass memos in the dependency array; they are plain
  `Subscribable` values, so chains like `subtotal → tax → total` work.

**Real use case** — derived totals in a cart: keep line items in a signal,
derive the subtotal and the formatted total with memos, and let an effect
persist or render the summary without recomputing it in every handler.

```ts
const [items, setItems] = useCreateSignal<CartItem[]>([]);

const subtotal = useCreateMemo(
  () => items().reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.qty, 0),
  [items],
);

const total = useCreateMemo(() => subtotal() * 1.21, [subtotal]);
```

## Effects

### useCreateEffect(callback, signals)

Runs a side effect immediately, then again whenever a subscribed signal emits a
new value. This is the bridge between the reactive graph and the outside world:
DOM updates, logging, storage writes, network calls.

**Parameters**

| Name       | Type                              | Description                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `callback` | `() => void \| (() => void)`      | Effect body; may return a cleanup function       |
| `signals`  | `Subscribable<unknown>[]`         | Signals that re-trigger the effect               |

**Returns** `() => void` — a dispose function that runs the final cleanup and
unsubscribes from every dependency.

```ts
import { useCreateSignal, useCreateEffect } from "katanakit-js";

const [name, setName] = useCreateSignal("world");

const dispose = useCreateEffect(() => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name()}!`);
  return () => console.log("cleaning up");
}, [name]);

setName("Katana"); // logs "cleaning up", then "Hello, Katana!"
dispose();         // runs the final cleanup and unsubscribes
```

**Cleanup rules and edge cases**

- **Immediate first run.** The callback executes synchronously during creation,
  so the effect reflects the initial state without an extra manual call.
- **Cleanup before every re-run.** If the callback returns a function, it runs
  before the next execution and once more on `dispose()` — the right place to
  clear timers, abort fetches or detach listeners.
- **Call `dispose()` once.** The returned function is not idempotent; invoking
  it twice runs the final cleanup twice. Keep the reference and drop it after
  teardown.
- **Errors are contained.** Exceptions thrown by the callback or by a cleanup
  are caught and logged through [`useLogger()`](/guides/services/logger)
  (`[createEffect] ...`); they never propagate to the setter.
- **Dependencies are explicit.** The effect does **not** inspect which signals
  the callback reads. A dependency you forget to list will not re-trigger the
  effect; an entry that does not implement `useSubscribe` is silently ignored.
- **Batched notifications.** Inside `batch()`, the effect runs once per queued
  notification when the outermost batch flushes, reading the final state.

**Real use case** — synchronize a preference with the document and the network:
the effect applies the theme to the root element and persists it, and its
cleanup detaches the class when the widget unmounts.

```ts
const [theme, setTheme] = useCreateStorageSignal("theme", "light");

const dispose = useCreateEffect(() => {
  const root = useGetRoot();
  if (!root) return;
  useToggleClass(root, "dark", theme() === "dark");
  return () => useRemoveClass(root, "dark");
}, [theme]);
```

### useCreateBatch()

Returns a `batch(callback)` function that **defers signal notifications** until
the callback completes. All primitives created by this module cooperate with
it — signals queue their notifications, and effects/memos run on the flush.

**Returns** `(callback: () => void) => void`.

```ts
import { useCreateBatch, useCreateSignal, useCreateEffect } from "katanakit-js";

const batch = useCreateBatch();
const [first, setFirst] = useCreateSignal("Ada");
const [last, setLast] = useCreateSignal("Lovelace");

useCreateEffect(() => {
  render(`${first()} ${last()}`);
}, [first, last]);

batch(() => {
  setFirst("Grace");
  setLast("Hopper");
  // No subscriber runs with an intermediate combination
});
```

**Cleanup rules and edge cases**

- **Nested batches are safe.** Only the outermost `batch()` flushes; an inner
  call simply joins the active queue.
- **Deferral, not coalescing.** Batching does not merge writes. If an effect
  subscribes to two changed signals it still runs once per notification at
  flush, always reading the final state; direct `useSubscribe` listeners
  receive each change in order with its historical `(newValue, oldValue)` pair.
- **Synchronous by design.** The callback type returns `void`; keep it
  synchronous. Awaiting inside a batch closes the batch before the async work
  finishes and reintroduces intermediate notifications.
- **Errors do not swallow the flush.** A throwing callback is caught and logged
  (`[createBatch] Batch block error:`), and the queued notifications still run.
- **Reusable.** `useCreateBatch()` returns a stable function bound to the
  module-level queue; create it once and reuse it across handlers.

**Real use case** — a submit handler that updates several related fields (name,
email, dirty flag) must not re-render or persist three times: wrap the writes
in `batch()` and subscribers observe one consistent update cycle.

## Stores / persistence

### useCreateStorageSignal(key, fallbackValue, target = "localStorage")

Creates a signal whose value is read from a storage backend at creation and
written back on every setter call. It composes the
[Storage](/guides/services/storage) service, inheriting its SSR-safe and
private-mode-safe behavior.

**Parameters**

| Name            | Type                          | Default          | Description                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `key`           | `string`                      | —                | Storage key                              |
| `fallbackValue` | `T`                           | —                | Value used when the key is absent        |
| `target`        | `"localStorage" \| "sessionStorage"` | `"localStorage"` | Backend to read from and write to |

**Returns** `[SignalGetter<T>, SignalSetter<T>]`. The setter accepts a value or
an updater and writes through to storage; the updater form computes the next
value against the current signal before persisting it.

```ts
import { useCreateStorageSignal } from "katanakit-js";

const [theme, setTheme] = useCreateStorageSignal<"light" | "dark">("theme", "light");

theme();          // "light" on first visit, or the stored value afterwards
setTheme("dark"); // updates the signal and writes to localStorage

const [token, setToken] = useCreateStorageSignal("token", "", "sessionStorage");

setToken((prev) => `${prev}-refreshed`); // updater is persisted too
```

**Cleanup rules and edge cases**

- **Reads happen once.** Only creation reads storage; a second tab writing the
  same key does not update this signal (no `storage` event subscription).
  Recreate the signal or call `useGetStorage(key, target)` to re-read.
- **Writes happen on every call.** Unlike notifications, storage is written
  even when the new value equals the previous one.
- **Serialization.** Values are stored as JSON; strings are stored raw. Keep
  values JSON-serializable (no `Map`, `Set`, `Date` instances or functions).
- **SSR fallback.** Outside the browser the Storage service returns `null`, so
  the signal starts from `fallbackValue`; writes go to an ephemeral in-memory
  store. Use `useRunStorageScope()` around a server handler to share that
  in-memory store within a single request.
- **Removal is separate.** The setter cannot delete the key; call
  `useRemoveStorage(key, target)` from the Storage service when the preference
  should be forgotten.
- **Quota and private mode are silent.** Failed writes are ignored by the
  storage strategy; the in-memory signal keeps working for the session.

**Real use case** — theme and locale preferences that must survive reloads but
degrade gracefully during SSG: the same module renders on the server with the
fallback and picks up the persisted value in the browser.
