# Services

Every service in KatanaKit follows the same architecture: a small public API
over a **pure core**, with the runtime I/O isolated behind it and SSR guards
where the browser or Node/Bun is touched. Two public shapes exist, and both are
re-exported as `use*` helpers from the package root:

- **Singleton facade classes** — `FetchApiManager`, `DatesService`,
  `LoggerService`, … expose `use*` methods and a `getInstance()` accessor.
- **Function modules with strategies** — DOM, storage, theme, viewport, observer
  and friends ship standalone `use*` functions; behavior is swapped through
  strategy objects (for example, `LocalStorageStrategy`,
  `SessionStorageStrategy` and `MemoryStorageStrategy` behind the storage API).

```ts
// Class-based facade
import { FetchApiManager } from "katanakit-js";

const api = FetchApiManager.getInstance();
api.useGetApi("pokeapi", "pokemonById", { params: { id: 25 } });

// Function module — same contract, no instance
import { useGetApi } from "katanakit-js";

useGetApi("pokeapi", "pokemonById", { params: { id: 25 } });
```

The [API Reference](/api/) is generated from the source; the pages below are
the task-oriented companion, with runnable examples per method.
